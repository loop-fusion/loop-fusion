# Tools
The `tools/` directory is designated for holding extra scripts and tools
related to developing and contributing to the project. For example, turn-key
build scripts, linting scripts, code-generation scripts, test scripts, or
other tools that may be useful to a project developer.

## Bash Scripts
I like bash scripts. That's why you'll find quite a few in this directory,
mostly for GitLabCI.

We use the "unofficial bash strict mode" in our bash scripts to avoid
having to debug them more than necessary.
